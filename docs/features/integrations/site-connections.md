This documentation provides information about how [Yoast SEO](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/) integrates with various search engine's tools and portals.

We provide tools for mananging verification codes for Baidu Webmaster Tools, Bing Webmaster Tools, Google Search Console, and Yandex Webmaster Tools.

## Managing verification codes
Each of the above vendors expects a distinct format, and has its own validation rules. We sanitize and validate inputs in line with those.

*Details pending*

## Outputting codes
Each validated input should result in a meta tag (with a distinct format in each case) being added to the `<head>` on the *homepage only*.

*Details pending*
