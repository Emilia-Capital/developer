# Progress Planner Developer docs

This repository holds all documentation that is hosted on [developer.progressplanner.com](https://developer.progressplanner.com).
All documentation is written in Markdown and is read by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) to be presented in a 
user-friendly manner.

## A few do's and dont's

### Do...
* ...ensure files always contain a proper Docusaurus header. Otherwise, the file will not properly show up.
* ...check that files are grouped logically (i.e. a category or feature) to ensure users can easily find information.
* ...use headings.
* ...split up large bodies of text in smaller files, if possible.
* ...test (newly added) links before submitting a PR to ensure we keep 404's at bay.
* ...Use [admonitions](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions) for tips, highlights and cautionary alerts. 

### Don't...
* ...hesitate to ask for help if something is unclear in how this project should work.

## Installation

After cloning this repository navigate to the directory where this repository is located and run:

```
$ yarn
```

That's it! You are ready to use the portal on your local machine.

After this, you have the following options:

### Local Development
To quickly test docs changes, just run:

```shell
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without 
having to restart the server.

**Please note:** If you don't want to keep reopening a new tab, ensure you run `yarn start --no-open`. You can also 
combine this command with `BROWSER=<your preferred browser>` to force Docusaurus to open in a different browser than 
Chrome.

If you want to test a bit more thoroughly, run a full build, and serve that locally.

### Production and development build
Just run:

```shell
yarn build
# And then to test it locally: 
yarn serve
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting 
service.

**Note:** the build will fail when there are broken internal links, so running this to test before you commit is a good 
idea. 

### Search
Search relies on this [Docusaurus search local package](https://github.com/easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local), and only 
works when you've done a full build as it needs to build a search index. 

### Adding redirects
To add redirects, add them to the [_redirects](_redirects) file. The pattern used is the Cloudflare pages [redirects 
format](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/redirects/), which includes support for splats and placeholders. 

### Deployment
Deployment is fully automatic and thus requires no configuration or user interaction.
