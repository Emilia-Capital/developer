# Yoast Developer docs

This repository holds all documentation that is hosted on [developer.yoast.com](https://developer.yoast.com). 
All documentation is written in Markdown and is read by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) to be presented in a user-friendly manner.

## A few do's and dont's

### Do...
* ...ensure files always contain a proper Docusaurus header. Otherwise, the file will not properly show up.
* ...ensure you edit the `editUrl` property to point to the exact path of the file on this repository.
* ...check that files are grouped logically (i.e. a category or feature) to ensure users can easily find information.
* ...use headings.
* ...split up large bodies of text in smaller files, if possible.
* ...test (newly added) links before submitting a PR to ensure we keep 404's at bay.

### Don't...
* ...hesitate to ask for help if something is unclear in how this project should work.
